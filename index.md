# Data Source

The data rely on the data from the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The European CDC publishes daily statistics on the COVID-19 pandemic. Not just for Europe, but for the entire world. [ECDC website](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en),  [data](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/ecdc/full_data.csv).



# Predictions

The total number of Covid 19 cases is predicted using the [Verhulstthe model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function), originally developed for growth modelling. We'll assume the total number of Covid 19 cases follows :

$$ f(t)=K \frac{1}{1+e^{-r(t - t_0)}} $$

$$ \cdot \ t_{0}= $$ the value  of the sigmoid's midpoint \\
$$\cdot \ K= $$ the capacity \\
$$\cdot \ r=$$ the logistic growth rate or steepness of the curve 

## Model fitting

The model is fitted to minimise the mean squared error (MSE):

$$ (t_0^{\star}, K^{\star}, r^{\star}) \in argmin \sum_{i=1}^{n}\big(y_i - f(t_i)^2\big) $$ 

When the capacity $$ K $$ is known, this model can be fitted using a linear regression transforming $$ f(t) $$ in  $$ g(t) = logit (\frac{f(t)}{K}) $$. 

$$ \operatorname{logit}\left(\frac{1}{1+e^{-r(t - t_0)}}\right)=\ln \left(\frac{1}{e^{-r(t - t_0)}}\right)= r t - t_0 $$

Here, $$ K $$ is unknown, and the model need to be fitted with numerical optimisation. Still, under reasonable conditions existence of optimal parameters exists. [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0096300395002510)

The [Nelder-Mead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelderâ€“Mead_method) optimisation algorithm is used to find the optimum parameters.

## Parameters distribution

The estimation of optimum parameters distribution is computed with a **Bootstrap** method. The distribution used to sample the parameters is linear, granting more importance to recent values than old ones.
